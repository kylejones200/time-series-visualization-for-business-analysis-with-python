## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Data source or synthetic generation
- Visualization options (time_series, multiple_series, seasonal_decomposition)
- Seasonal period for decomposition
- Output settings

## Visualization Types

### Time Series Plot
- Basic line plot of time series
- Clean, minimalist design

### Multiple Series
- Compare multiple time series
- Useful for business metrics

### Seasonal Decomposition
- Trend, seasonal, and residual components
- Helps understand patterns

## Caveats

- By default, generates synthetic business data.
- Seasonal period should match data frequency.
- Visualizations are optimized for business reporting.
